Welcome to this step-by-step tutorial on creating an incremental game.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of building a simple incremental game where users can gain coins and invest in upgrades to increase their coin earnings. We'll leverage the capabilities of eMath.js to manage currency, boosts, and upgrades efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) for comfortable coding.
- Either:
	- NodeJS and npm
	- or a browser to view HTML

## What You'll Learn
Throughout this tutorial, you'll gain hands-on experience in:

- Using eMath.js for managing currency and boosts.
- Implementing a simple gain mechanism for earning coins.
- Creating an upgrade system with cost scaling and level-dependent effects.
By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a functional incremental game with a basic economy system powered by eMath.js.
