After you have set up the basics, now it's time to set up the game.

<Tabs groupId="jsOrTs" defaultValue="js" values={[{label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'},{label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'}]}>
    <TabItem value="js">
```js title="script.js"
const { Decimal, Game } = window.eMath;

// Initialize game with options
const gameOptions = {
    // Name of the game (optional)
    name: {
        id: "coinGame", // ID of the game, used for saving and loading
        name: "Coin Game", // Name of the game, cosmetic
        version: "0.1.0", // Version of the game
    },
};

const coinGame = new Game(gameOptions);
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="ts">
```ts title="script.ts"
import { Decimal } from "emath.js";
import { Game } from "emath.js/game";

// Initialize game with options
const gameOptions: GameConfigOptions = {
    // Name of the game (optional)
    name: {
        id: "coinGame", // ID of the game, used for saving and loading
        title: "Coin Game", // Name of the game, cosmetic
        version: "0.1.0", // Version of the game
    },
};

const coinGame = new Game(gameOptions);
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Explanation:

- The `Game` class is imported from the `eMath` object. This class is used to create the game.
- The `gameOptions` object is defined to store the game's name, ID, and version. For all options, see the [Game](../../game/game) documentation.

{/* Next, we'll create a currency system to manage the player's coins. */}

After this step, you can continue to the [currency tutorial](./currency).
