After you have set up [the game](./game), now it's time to set up the currency and upgrades.

<Tabs groupId="jsOrTs" defaultValue="js" values={[{label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'}, {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'}]}>
    <TabItem value="js">
```js title="script.js"
// ... Previous code

// Upgrades for the currency
const coinUpgrades = [
    {
        id: "upg1Coins", // Unique ID
        cost: level => level.mul(10), // Cost of 10 times the level
        maxLevel: new Decimal(1000),
        effect: (level, upgradeContext, currencyContext) => {
            // `currencyContext` is the context of the currency (coins in this case)

            // Access the `boost` object to add a boost
            currencyContext.boost.setBoost({
                id: "boostUpg1Coins", // Unique ID of the boost
                // Effect of the boost, which is additive, 11 times the level of the upgrade
                value: n => n.plus(level.mul(11)).sub(1),
            });
        },
    },
    // Add more upgrades here ...
];

// Create a new currency with upgrades
const coins = coinGame.addCurrency("coins", coinUpgrades);
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="ts">
```ts title="script.ts"
// ... Previous code

// Upgrades for the currency
const coinUpgrades = [
    {
        id: "upg1Coins", // Unique ID
        cost: (level): Decimal => level.mul(10), // Cost of 10 times the level
        maxLevel: new Decimal(1000), // Maximum level of 1000
        effect: (level, upgradeContext, currencyContext): void => {
            // `currencyContext` is the context of the currency (coins in this case)

            // Access the `boost` object to add a boost
            currencyContext.boost.setBoost({
                id: "boostUpg1Coins", // Unique ID of the boost
                // Effect of the boost, which is additive, 11 times the level of the upgrade
                value: n => n.plus(level.mul(11)).sub(1),
            });
        },
    },
    // Add more upgrades here ...
] as const satisfies UpgradeInit[]; // Type assertion to provide upgrade type checking

// Create a new currency with upgrades
const coins = coinGame.addCurrency("coins", coinUpgrades);
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Explanation:
- The `coinUpgrades` array contains the upgrades for the currency. Each upgrade object has the following properties:
  - `id`: A unique ID for the upgrade.
  - `cost`: A function that calculates the cost of the upgrade based on the current level.
  - `maxLevel`: The maximum level the upgrade can reach.
  - `effect`: A function that defines the effect of the upgrade. In this case, it adds a boost to the currency context.
  - Other properties can be added as needed. See the [Upgrade](../../main/upgrade) documentation for more details.
- The `coins` object is created using the `addCurrency` method of the `coinGame` object. This method creates a new currency with the specified upgrades.

After this step, you can continue to the [reset layer tutorial](./reset).
