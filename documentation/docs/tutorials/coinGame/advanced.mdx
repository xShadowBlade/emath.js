After you have set up [display](./display), you can optionally add advanced features to your game.

This tutorial will cover the following advanced features:
- Hotkeys
- Save and Load

<Tabs groupId="jsOrTs" defaultValue="js" values={[{label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'}, {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'}]}>
    <TabItem value="js">
```js title="script.js"
// ... Previous code

// Data loading

// Initialize / Load game
// Only do this after all currencies and upgrades are added
coinGame.init();
coinGame.dataManager.loadData();

// Hotkeys
coinGame.keyManager.addKey([
    {
        id: "gainCoins",
        name: "Gain Coins",
        key: "g",
        onDownContinuous: () => coins.gain(),
    },
    {
        id: "buyUpgrades",
        name: "Buy Upgrades",
        key: "b",
        onDownContinuous: () => coins.buyUpgrade("upg1Coins"),
    },
]);

// Saving and Loading
window.addEventListener("beforeunload", () => {
    coinGame.dataManager.saveData();
});
coinGame.eventManager.setEvent("autoSave", "interval", 30000, () => {
    coinGame.dataManager.saveData();
    console.log("Auto Saved!");
});
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="ts">
```ts title="script.ts"
// ... Previous code

// Data loading

// Initialize / Load game
// Only do this after all currencies and upgrades are added
coinGame.init();
coinGame.dataManager.loadData();

// Hotkeys

        key: "g",
        onDownContinuous: (): void => void coins.gain(),
    },

// Saving and Loading
window.addEventListener("beforeunload", () => {

```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Explanation:
- The `init` method is called to initialize the game. This method should be called after all currencies and upgrades are added. The `loadData` method is called to load the game data. For more information, see the [DataManager](../../game/dataManager) documentation.
- The `keyManager` object is used to add hotkeys to the game. The `addKey` method is used to add a key with an ID, name, key, and function to execute when the key is pressed. For more information, see the [KeyManager](../../game/keyManager) documentation.
- The `dataManager` object is used to save and load data. The `saveData` method is used to save the game data, and the `loadData` method is used to load the game data. For more information, see the [DataManager](../../game/dataManager) documentation.
- The `autoSave` event is set to save the game data every 30 seconds. This is useful for automatically saving the game data at regular intervals. For more information, see the [EventManager](../../game/eventManager) documentation.
