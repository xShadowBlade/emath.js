Version 9 of eMath.js will release with a few changes. This guide will help you migrate your existing code from version 8 to version 9.

The following changes have been made in version 9:
- Change from `E` to `Decimal` class from break_eternity.js
- Change from `ESource` type to `DecimalSource` type

You should still import from `"emath.js"` instead of `"break_eternity.js"`, but the `Decimal` class is now used instead of the `E` class.

> Note: You can still use the `E` class if you prefer.

{/* ## Change from `E` to `Decimal` class

In version 9, the `E` class has been removed and replaced with the `Decimal` class from `break_eternity.js`. You should import the `Decimal` class from `break_eternity.js` and use it instead of the `E` class. */}

## Change from `ESource` to `DecimalSource`

In version 9, the `ESource` type has been renamed to `DecimalSource`.

```ts title="script.ts"
import { DecimalSource } from "emath.js";
```

### Change from `E` to `Decimal`

In version 9, the `E` class has been removed and replaced with the `Decimal` class from `break_eternity.js`.

```ts title="script.ts"
// Before (v8)
import { E } from "emath.js";

const number = E(10);
const result = E.add(number, E(5));

// After (v9)
import { Decimal } from "emath.js";

const number = new Decimal(10);
const result = Decimal.add(number, new Decimal(5));
```

You could still use the `E` function, but it is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.

### Regexes

Here are some regexes that you can use to replace the `E` class with the `Decimal` class in your code:

(Tip: In VSCode you can use the `Ctrl + Shift + H` shortcut to open the search and replace panel for all files, then click the `.*` button to enable regex mode)

Search:

```regex
ESource
```

Replace:

```regex
DecimalSource
```

---

Search:

```regex
E\((.*?)\)
```

Replace:

```regex
new Decimal($1)
```

---

(you should be careful with this one, as it might replace other instances of `E` that are not the `E` class)

Search:

```regex
E
```

Replace:

```regex
Decimal
```
