Version 9 of eMath.js will release with a few changes. This guide will help you migrate your existing code from version 8 to version 9.

The following changes have been made in version 9:
- Change from `E` to `Decimal` class from break_eternity.js
    {/* - `E` class has been removed and replaced with `Decimal` class from `break_eternity.js`. */}
    - `ESource` type has been renamed to `DecimalSource`, however you should import it from `break_eternity.js`

{/* ## Change from `E` to `Decimal` class

In version 9, the `E` class has been removed and replaced with the `Decimal` class from `break_eternity.js`. You should import the `Decimal` class from `break_eternity.js` and use it instead of the `E` class. */}

## Change from `ESource` to `DecimalSource`

In version 9, the `ESource` type has been renamed to `DecimalSource`. You should import it from `break_eternity.js` and use it instead of `ESource`.

```ts title="script.ts"
import { DecimalSource } from "break_eternity.js";
```

### Change from `E` to `Decimal`

In version 9, the `E` class has been removed and replaced with the `Decimal` class from `break_eternity.js`. You should still import the `Decimal` class from `emath.js` and use it instead of the `E` class.

```ts title="script.ts"
// Before (v8)
import { E } from "emath.js";

const number = E(10);
const result = E.add(number, E(5));

// After (v9)
import { Decimal } from "emath.js";

const number = new Decimal(10);
const result = Decimal.add(number, new Decimal(5));
```

### Regexes
