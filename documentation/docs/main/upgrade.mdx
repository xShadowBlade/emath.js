The `Upgrade` class represents an upgrade that can be bought with a currency. It is used to store the cost of the upgrade, the effect of the upgrade, and the maximum level of the upgrade.

It is used internally by the `CurrencyStatic` class to calculate the cost and amount of upgrades that can be bought. It is not recommended to use this class on its own without a `CurrencyStatic` class.
 
## Usage

There are three ways to create upgrades:

1. Create upgrades using the second parameter of the `<Game>.addCurrency` method. (Recommended)
2. Create upgrades with the second parameter of the constructor of the `CurrencyStatic` class.
3. Using the `addUpgrade` method of the `CurrencyStatic` class. (Deprecated)

<Tabs groupId="jsOrTs" defaultValue="js" values={[{label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js'}, {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'}]}>
    <TabItem value="js">
```js title="script.js" showLineNumbers
// Import game if using the first method
import { myGame } from "./game.js";

// Upgrades for the currency
const myCurrencyUpgrades = [
    {
        id: "upg1", // Unique ID
        cost: level => level.mul(2), // Cost of 2 times the level
        maxLevel: new Decimal(1000), // Maximum level of 1000
        effect: (level) => console.log(`Bought upgrade to level ${level}`),
    },
    // Add more upgrades here ...
];

// Create a new currency in `Game` with upgrades (recommended)
const myCurrency = myGame.addCurrency("myCurrency", myCurrencyUpgrades);

// Create a new currency with upgrades
const myCurrency = new CurrencyStatic(undefined, myCurrencyUpgrades);
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="ts">

If you are using TypeScript, it is also recommended to do type assertion with the upgrades array to get better type checking with upgrade ids with methods such as `getUpgrade` and `buyUpgrade`.

```ts title="script.ts"
// For TypeScript, you need to import the type
import type { UpgradeInit } from "emath.js";
// Import game if using the first method
import { myGame } from "./game";

// Upgrades for the currency
const myCurrencyUpgrades = [
    {
        id: "upg1", // Unique ID
        cost: level => level.mul(2), // Cost of 2 times the level
        maxLevel: new Decimal(1000), // Maximum level of 1000
        effect: (level) => console.log(`Bought upgrade to level ${level}`),
    },
    // Add more upgrades here ...
// Type assertion for better type checking
] as const satisfies UpgradeInit[];

// Create a new currency in `Game` with upgrades (recommended)
const myCurrency = myGame.addCurrency("myCurrency", myCurrencyUpgrades);

// Create a new currency with upgrades
const myCurrency = new CurrencyStatic(undefined, myCurrencyUpgrades);
```
    </TabItem>
